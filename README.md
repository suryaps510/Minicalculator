HTML, CSS, and JS create a basic calculator with math operations, input field, number/operator buttons, clear/delete functions, and color themes (blue, orange, red, purple, pink). JS adds interactivity for calculations and theme switching. Users can personalize the UI, enhancing usability and aesthetics.
